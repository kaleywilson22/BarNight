# BarNight
## App Description
Finding friends in a new city is hard. Inspired my college's bar night, this app will bring together people with similar careers, hobbies, interests, and personalities. They will be able to chat with eachother, reserve a table at a bar, and gather to make new friends.

Bars often have a hard time filling their tables on weekdays like Monday-Thursday. The goal is for bars to make more business on their off days by allowing reservations to be made through bar night. This gives the bar more business and Bar Night users a convienent way to plan and meet.
